# Credit Risk Analysis for peer to peer lending firm Bandora
The credit risk is analyzed to measure the possibility of loss as result of borrower failing to repay a loan or meeting the loan obligations. The more the credit risk the more it has a negative impact on performance of bank. The credit risk analysis is important because it allows the bank to plan strategies to avoid a negative outcome ahead in future.
- In this project we analyzed the credit risk on individual loans, maximizing the Return on Investment (ROI) by predicting an Eligible Loan Amount and minimizing the financial risk between the lending firm Bandora and the borrowers.

## Understanding the Dataset
Data for the study has been retrieved from a publicly available data set of a leading European P2P lending platform  ([**Bondora**](https://www.bondora.com/en/public-reports#dataset-file-format))

- The dataset contains the individual loan details from **2009** to **2019** having both the **defaulted** and **non-defaulted** loans
- The dataset does not contain any target attributes for 
  - defaulted, non-defauted borrowers
  - Eligible Loan Amount (ELA)
  - Return on Investment (ROI)
  - Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) 
- These 4 target attributes will be created using feature engineering

The dataset has 112 attributes intially. The following table briefly explains the attribute definitions.

| LossGivenDefault                       | Gives the percentage of outstanding exposure at the time of default that an investor is likely to lose if a loan actually defaults. This means the proportion of funds lost for the investor after all expected recovery and accounting for the time value of the money recovered. In general, LGD parameter is intended to be estimated based on the historical recoveries. However, in new markets where limited experience does not allow us more precise loss given default estimates, a LGD of 90% is assumed. |

No provisions for future losses are made & only received (not accrued or scheduled) interest payments are taken into account.                                                                                          |


## Preprocessing
As the dataset is not clean, so preprocessing techniques were used to clean the dataset and make it ready for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- The attributes having greater than 40% missing values were filtered out.
- There are some features which have no role in targets, so they are also removed:
  - 'ReportAsOfEOD', 'LoanId', 'LoanNumber', 'ListedOnUTC', 'DateOfBirth' (because age is already present), 'BiddingStartedOn','UserName','NextPaymentNr','NrOfScheduledPayments','IncomeFromPrincipalEmployer', 'IncomeFromPension', 'IncomeFromFamilyAllowance', 'IncomeFromSocialWelfare','IncomeFromLeavePay', 'IncomeFromChildSupport', 'IncomeOther' (As Total income is already present which is total of all these income), 'LoanApplicationStartedDate','ApplicationSignedHour', 'ApplicationSignedWeekday','ActiveScheduleFirstPaymentReached', 'PlannedInterestTillDate', 'LastPaymentOn', 'ExpectedLoss', 'LossGivenDefault', 'ExpectedReturn', 'ProbabilityOfDefault', 'PrincipalOverdueBySchedule', 'StageActiveSince', 'ModelVersion','WorseLateCategory'
- As no time series analysis is involved in our project, so some attributes involving date-time are removed:
   - 'LoanDate', 'FirstPaymentDate','MaturityDate_Original','MaturityDate_Last','LastPaymentOn'
   - note that attribute 'DefaultDate' is not removed, because it contains the default date for those borrowers who defaulted and - for those borrowers who didn't default. This attribute will help us in creating the our 1st target attribute (defaulted, non-defauted borrowers).
-  There are some attributes in numeric form in the dataset but they are actually categorical attributes as per data description such as :
   -  Verification Type, Language Code, Gender, Use of Loan, Education, Marital Status,EmployementStatus, OccupationArea, 
   - These attributes are converted to categorial type by using the respective attribute definition, to make these variables correct for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   - Like for Gender attribute replacing [0,1,2] by ["Male","Woman","Undefined"] as per attribute definition of Gender.

   - When the data distribution is checked for these attributes, there are some unreplacable values like :
      - 22, 15, 10, 13, 7, 21 in 'LanguageCode' attribute.
      - -1 in 'UseOfLoan'
      -  0, -1 in 'Education'
      - -1 in 'MaritalStatus'
      - -1, 0, 6 in 'EmploymentStatus'
      - -1, 0 in 'OccupationArea'
      - -1 in 'HomeOwnershipType'

- To perform the Credit Risk Analysis, We need to create the 4 Target attributes, 1 for Classification and 3 for Regression
  1) For Classification, we need to create a Default/non-Default binary class Target attribute:
    - Here, status is the variable which help us in creating target variable. The reason for not making status as target variable is that it has three unique values current, Late and repaid. There is no default feature but there is a feature default date which tells us when the borrower has defaulted means on which date the borrower defaulted. So, we will be combining Status and Default date features for creating target variable.The reason we cannot simply treat Late as default because it also has some records in which actual status is Late but the user has never defaulted i.e., default date is null. So we will first filter out all the current status records because they are not matured yet they are current loans.
    - The Status attribute consists of three classes : Current, Late, Repaid
    - So filtering out those rows in dataset where status is either Late or Repaid
    - Creating a new variable DefaultTarget, by assigning 1 to those rows where there is a value for defaultDate attribute and 0 to other.
    - It means those borrowers having default date belong to defaulted class in our target attribute
  2) **For Regression, we need to calculate Equated Monthly Installment, Eligible Loan Amount (ELA), Return On investment ROI (Risk to get profit)**
    - The **EMI** is calculated based on the following mathematical formula: **EMI = P × r × (1 + r) ^ n / ((1 + r) ^ n – 1)**
      - Where P = Loan amount. "Amount", r = Rate of interest, which is calculated on a monthly-basis-Interest, n = Loan tenure (in months).
  3) **Eligible Loan Amount**, ELA = Assets (Income) - Liabilities of the borrower
    - **Assets**:
      -  **FreeCash** = ELA
      -   **TotalIncome** - **LiabilitiesTotal** = ELA
      -   Under Concsideration, Eligible Loan Amount means, with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is an Eligible Loan, the lesser of:
        - the Principal Balance of such Eligible Loan, AppliedAmount
        - the Market Value of such Eligible Loan PurchasePrice | BidPrinciple
    -  **Approach Followed :**
        - Calculate AppliedAmount + AppliedAmount*Interest = Total Liabilities Amount
        - Divide by the loan tenure (months)
        - If the result is less than (TotalIncome- LiabilitiesTotal)*30/100
        - Then allow the Applied Amount, If not allow only the result of the previous calculation.
  4) **Preferred ROI**
    - We weren't able to determine the procedure of handling Risk related to loan in order to determine Preferred ROI.
    - In order to complete the task in hand and complete it, we'll calculate ROI instead : 
      - **ROI = Investment Gain / Investment Base**
      - **ROI = Amount lended * interest/100**



## Data Wrangling
Using the techniques of data wrangling, errors were removed, gaps in the dataset were indentified, the data imputation was done to make the data ready for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Incorrect data entry is checked for the categorical attributes.
  - City and County
    - Upon exploring the city attribute and checking the distribution
    - The two major cities with counts are Tallinn : 6467 , TALLINN : 5395
    - As we can see these two cities are same, so typing error exists in our dataset.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/resources/media/2.png">
</p>

  - By removing the trailing space (_*) and converting to lower case, the inconsistent data entry is corrected.
- Columns with missing values are indentified:
  - VerificationType 0.058 %, Gender 0.058 %, MonthlyPayment 8.56 %, County 26.5 %, City 6.51 %, Education 0.058 %
  - MaritalStatus 0.058 %, EmploymentStatus 0.25 %, EmploymentDurationCurrentEmployer 1.12 %, OccupationArea 0.11 % 
  - HomeOwnershipType 2.13 %, DebtToIncome 0.058 %, FreeCash 0.05 %, Rating 3.52 %, CreditScoreEsMicroL 33.83 %
  - PreviousRepaymentsBeforeLoan 24.95 %
- Data Imputation
  - The missing values are imputed with different approach for numerical and categorical attributes.
    - After checking the distribution of numerical attributes, it is observed that majority of attributes have highly skewed distribution
    - So to replace the missing values, the median of respective attribute is used instead of mean() because for skewed attributes, we don't use mean() for imputation

<p align="center">
  <img src="/resources/media/3.png">
</p>

    - The missing values in categorical attributes are imputed with the mode() of respective attributes.

- **Observations For Categorial Bivariate Analysis**
  - The countplot is like histogram for categorical attributes. So its easy to get insights about such attributes with target attributes
  - New 'NewCreditCustomers' are more likey to default than existing.
  - The customers having 'income and expenses verified', 'income verified' are more likely to default than others.
  - The Estonians are less likely to default and 'finnish','spanish' are more likely to default.
  - The males are more likely to default than females
  - Customers with 'undefined','home improvement''other' use of loan are more likely to default.
  - Customers with vocational education are more likely to default as it has more defualt ratio than other classes.
  - Customers with CredictScoreEsMicroL are more likely to default.
  - Customers with undefined maritalstatus are defaulting more than those with defined maritalstatus.
  - Customers with undefined Employment status are more likely to default than those with defined. SO customers must have defined employmentstatus.
  - Customers with employment duration more than 5 years are defaulting more. so compnany should avoid should customers.
  - Customers with undefined occupationArea are defaulting more.
  - Customrs with 'yes' restructured are more likely to default than others.
  - Tenants, prefurnised property owners are likely to default more as defualt ratio is more this class than owners.
  - The customers with HR rating are defaulting more as this class has more default ratio than F class. we can see from plot of Rating.

### Multivariate Analysis:
- In multivariate analysis, the relation and trend among multiple features is analyzed at same time to get insights into the dataset.
- it becomes easy when we have performed bivariate analysis and plotted correlation heatmaps.
- it is done among the features having good correlations to expose the trends and insights.

**- Some of the multivariate plots are given below:**

  <img src="/resources/media/m3.png"><img src="/resources/media/m4.png">
  <img src="/resources/media/m5.png">
</p>

- **FINAL observations are:**
  - Borrowers with low Loan Amount and High interest rates have greater chance of defaulting than with those having low amount and low interest.
  - Borrowers with high loan Amount and less chances have low chances of defaulting.
  - Borrowers with high interest and longer loanDuration have high chances of defaulting than those who have low interest and shorter loanDuration
  - Borrowers having having low Loan amount and a non zero previous loans before loan have low chance of getting defualted.
  - Borrowers having no previous loans before loan have high chances of defaulting .
  - Borrowers having high loan amount and high no of existingliabilities have high chances of defaulting
  - Borrowers having high principal balance and high loan amount have likely less chances of defaulting
  - Borrowers having less interest and low monthlyPayment have likely less chances of defualting
  - Borrowers having low MonthlyPayments and shorter LoanDurations have less chances of defaulting and vice versa.
  - no clear trend among Amount, EmploymentStatus and target Default/non-default.
  - no clear trend among LoanDuration, MaritalStatus and target Default/non-default.
  - no clear trend among Amount, Age and target Default/non-default.
  - no clear trend among BidsPortfolioManager, Amount and target Default/non-default
  - The County and City attributes are very diverse, no clear relationships can be indentified from such diverse features.

**Descriptive Statistics:**

<p align="center">
  <img src="/resources/media/descriptive_statistics.png">
</p>

## Feature Engineering

Features in datadset are not ready for model building as we need to treat outliers, encode categorical variables, select features which are actually contributing to prediction of target variable.

**Mutual Information Scores**

1. As Mutual information is univariate scoring method we can not rely much on that to removing features
2. fetures with least scores can be useful when combined with other variables

InterestAndPenaltyBalance                 0.34
PrincipalPaymentsMade                     0.27
PrincipalBalance                          0.25
RecoveryStage                             0.15

Above features are highly contributing towards target variable

**Outliers treatment**

Numerical variables were included with outliers in both direction, we treated all of them with IQR method

*Method*

IQR = Inter quantile range is range between 75th and 25th quantile 
Lower bound = 25th quantile - 1.5*IQR
Upper bound = 75th quantile + 1.5*IQR

Now after defining upper and lower bound
- For each numeric variable, we checked which values are outside of their respective bounds
- Values less than lower bound replaced by "Lower bound" 
- Similarly values higher than upper bound were replaced by "Upper bound"

**Categorical encoding**

'target', 'NewCreditCustomer','VerificationType', 'LanguageCode', 'Gender', 'Country', 'UseOfLoan','Education', 'MaritalStatus', 'EmploymentStatus','EmploymentDurationCurrentEmployer', 'OccupationArea','HomeOwnershipType', 'Restructured', 'CreditScoreEsMicroL'

are the variables which are categorical i.e. "Object" datatype
- we selected these columns for encoding inside pipeline using "make_column_selector" from sklearn.compose module
- One Hot Encoding is used here for categorical variable encoding.
- The reason for using this method is because some variables were ordinal categories and some were nominal categories
    - Encoding these variables with label encoder may result in bad performance and explanability of machine learning model at the end
- From sklearn.preprocessing module we imported and instantiated the One Hot encoder class and used inside column transformer selecting only categorical variables

**Scaling the features**

- We used Ridge regressior as regression algorithm to predict target variables.
- The performance of ridge regressor will be better without any bias to higher values after using scaled features was the main intention of scaling
- We used Standard Scaler from sklearn.preprocessing module

*StandardScaler Methodology*

The standard score of a sample x is calculated as:

z = (x - u) / s

where u is the mean of the training samples or zero if with_mean=False, and s is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if with_std=False.

- We used "with_mean=False" as we wanted our features not to be centred 

- We used Standard scaling inside pipeline for all the variables (Including one hot encoded target variables)


## Model Building
#### Metrics considered for Model Evaluation
**Accuracy , Precision , Recall and F1 Score**
- Accuracy: What proportion of actual positives and negatives is correctly classified?
- Precision: What proportion of predicted positives are truly positive ?
- Recall: What proportion of actual positives is correctly classified ?
- F1 Score : Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall

#### Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression helps find how probabilities are changed with actions.
- The function is defined as P(y) = 1 / 1+e^-(A+Bx) 
- Logistic regression involves finding the **best fit S-curve** where A is the intercept and B is the regression coefficient. The output of logistic regression is a probability score.

#### Random Forest Classifier
- The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of **many decision trees**. It uses bagging and features randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.

#### Linear Regression
- In this method it attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. 
- One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is dependent variable.

#### Ridge Regression
- It is the method used for the analysis of multicollinearity in multiple regression data. It is most suitable when a data set contains a higher number of predictor variables than the number of observations.
- Multicollinearity happens when predictor variables exhibit a correlation among themselves. It aims at reducing the standard error by adding some bias in the estimates of the regression.
- The reduction of the standard error in regression estimates significantly increases the reliability of the estimates.

**We tranined 4 models; 2 for classification and 2 for regression**
- When we trained the **logistic regression** model the F1_score we got 82.11%. After tuning parameters using GridSearchCV we got F1_score as 83.36%.
- When we trained **random forest classifier** model using best hyperparameters the F1_score we got 92.86%. After removing unimportant features, we got F1_score as 93.03%.
- When we trained **linear Regression** the R2_score we got is 78.46%.
- When we trained **Ridge Regression** the R2_score we got is 89%.

*Finally, 2 pipelines are deployed:*
1. **Random Forest Classifier (Binary Classification)**

2. **Ridge Regression for multi targets (EMI, ELA, ROI)**
